Based on our interactions and the code I've seen, here's my assessment of the project as an MVP, keeping in mind you're not primarily a frontend developer.

### Overall Assessment

This is a **very solid foundation for an MVP**. For someone who doesn't consider themselves a frontend developer, the structure and quality are impressive.

**Verdict:** Yes, with the understanding that some parts are mocked, this is definitely on the right track to be considered a good MVP. It demonstrates the core functionality and has a consistent, clean UI.

### Strengths (What you've done well)

1.  **Excellent Project Structure:** You have a logical and scalable folder structure. Separating `components`, `pages`, `stores`, and `utils` is a best practice that makes the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.
2.  **Modern Tech Stack:** Using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS is a great choice. It's a modern, efficient, and highly popular stack that's great for building quickly.
3.  **Component Reusability:** You've done a great job of creating reusable components like `Input`, `Button`, `Selectbox`, and now `MaskedInput`. This is the core principle of React, and you've implemented it effectively.
4.  **Clean UI:** The consistent use of Tailwind CSS and a component-driven approach has resulted in a clean, professional-looking user interface.

### Areas for Improvement (Considerations for a more robust MVP)

These are not criticisms, but rather the next logical steps to make the application feel more complete and professional to an end-user.

1.  **User Feedback and State Management:**
    *   **Loading States:** When a user clicks "Save," the application should provide immediate feedback that something is happening. Currently, the UI doesn't change while the (mocked) save operation is in progress. Consider disabling the "Save" button and showing a spinner to prevent multiple clicks and inform the user.
    *   **Success/Error Notifications:** After an action is completed, inform the user what happened. If a save is successful, a small, temporary message (often called a "toast") saying "Client saved successfully!" is very helpful. If it fails, you should show an error message explaining what went wrong. This is crucial for a good user experience.
    *   **Form "Dirty" State:** In components like `ClientEditor`, the "Save" button is always active. Ideally, it should only be enabled after the user has actually made a change to the data.

2.  **Code Quality and Robustness:**
    *   **Prop Validation:** Since you are using JavaScript instead of TypeScript, it would be beneficial to use the `prop-types` library. This helps catch bugs by ensuring that components receive the correct type of data (e.g., ensuring the `terms` prop in `TermList` is always an array).
    *   **Error Boundaries:** React has a concept called "Error Boundaries." These are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. This prevents a single bug in a small component from crashing the entire application.

3.  **Minor UX Enhancements:**
    *   **Empty States:** What does the `TermList` component look like when there are no terms? Instead of showing nothing, it's good practice to display a message like "No terms have been added yet. Click 'Add Term' to get started."
    *   **Focus Management:** After adding a new term, consider automatically setting the focus to the first input field of that new term to improve keyboard navigation and workflow.

### Summary

You have built a strong foundation. The core structure is sound, the UI is clean, and the component model is well-executed. To elevate this from a developer prototype to a user-ready MVP, the most impactful next step would be to focus on **user feedback**: implementing loading indicators and success/error notifications.

You are doing an excellent job, especially for someone working outside of their primary domain. Keep up the great work
